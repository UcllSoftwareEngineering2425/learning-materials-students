# Agile Methodologies

There are multiple ***methodologies*** that promise you good software if you develop software according to their principles. Two of the most commonly used one are **Scrum** and **Kanban**:

* [What is Kanban?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaFVa7HYj4)
* [How is Scrum different from Kanban?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIaz-l1Kf8w)

Always remember that there is a distinction between the principles of Agile and software development methodologies.

Methodologies can be extremely useful, but they are not useful [when followed blindly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi4SOP2ElAw).

## Scrum

In this course, you will simulate developing software using the Scrum methodology.

Here is a brief outline of the most important Scrum concepts:

* **Sprint**: a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and getting sprints right helps your team ship better software.
* **Product Backlog**: a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. The product backlog is allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers, it's not necessary to start a project with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all requirements.
* **Sprint Planning**: a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions:

  * What work can get done in this sprint?
  * How will the chosen work get done? 

  The team creates a plan for how they will build the sprint backlog items and get them "Done" before the end of the sprint. By the end of sprint planning the team is ready to start work on the sprint backlog, pulling items from the product backlog.
* **Sprint Goal**: a one-sentence summary of the focus of the sprint.
* **Sprint Backlog**: the work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the sprint backlog.
* **Scrum Board (or, confusingly, Kanban Board)**: a visual representation of the progress of the Sprint. The board shows the work still to-do (the Sprint Backlog), the work in progress and the work done.
* **Daily Scrum (or Standup)**: the goal of this meeting is to surface any blockers and challenges that would impact the team's ability to deliver the sprint goal. Keep it short and to the point by answering the following questions:

  * What have you done?
  * What are you going to do?
  * Impediments?
* **Sprint Review**: after a sprint, the team demonstrates what they've completed during the sprint review. During the sprint review, a demo is given and the status of the Scrum Board is discussed.
* **Sprint Retro**: round-up of the sprint. An opportunity to identify areas of improvement for the next sprint. 

While working this way, people take up one or more ***roles*** within the scrum methodology:

* **Product Owner**: creates and manages the product backlog. Figures out the direction of the development.
* **Scrum Master**: glues everything together and ensures that scrum is being done well.
* **Developer**: person that does the "work". Work is defined broader than just programming: analysis, QA and develops are, for example, all part of the work that needs to be done. So, that means the ‘developer’ role in scrum means a team member who has the right skills, as part of the team to do the work.

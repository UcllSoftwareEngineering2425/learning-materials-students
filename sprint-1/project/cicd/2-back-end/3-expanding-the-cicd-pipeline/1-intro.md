# Intro

In these tasks we will finish the cicd pipelines for the backend. The goal is that **your default branch (normally "main")** will be built and deployed to Azure every time you push new code.

You are encouraged to go through the reference material so that you have the necessary background knowledge.

## 1. Reference

* [cicd](<./../../../../reference/cicd/1 - cicd.md>)
    * What is cicd and why is it important?
* GitHub
    * Started out as a part of the git ecosystem but has evolved to a whole build platform tightly integrated with Azure
    * [GitHub the platform](<./../../../..//reference/cicd/github/1 - github.md>); get to know the many faces of GitHub
    * [GitHub Actions](<./../../../..//reference/cicd/github/2 - github-actions.md>); we will use GitHub Actions as a build system
    * [GitHub Packages](<./../../../..//reference/cicd/github/3 - github-packages.md>); we will use GitHub Packages as a storage place for our build artifacts

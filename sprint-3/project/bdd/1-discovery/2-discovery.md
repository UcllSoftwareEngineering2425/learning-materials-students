# Discovery

The goal of the Discovery phase in BDD is to create a shared understanding of the requirements using User Stories and Acceptance Criteria. The good news is that you have already gone through this phase in Sprint 2: analysis.

However, it's important to review the acceptance criteria of the user stories you defined in Sprint 2 for the chosen extension. Ensure they are clear, specific and testable. If you find any issues, you should update them before moving on to the Formulation phase.

# Intro

In this sprint, you will learn about Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and how to apply it to your project. You will go through the different phases of BDD, including discovery, formulation, and automation. You will learn how to write executable specifications using Gherkin and how to automate these specifications using a BDD framework like Cucumber.

Before you start, make sure to read the [reference documents](../../../reference/bdd/1-bdd.md) about BDD.

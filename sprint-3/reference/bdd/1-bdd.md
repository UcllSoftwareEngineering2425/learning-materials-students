# Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that extends Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing test cases in a natural language that non-technical stakeholders can understand. This approach encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to ensure that the software meets the desired behaviour.

The BDD process typically involves three phases:

1. **Discovery**: In this phase, the team collaborates to understand the desired behaviour of the application. This involves discussions between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to create a shared understanding of the requirements. User stories and acceptance criteria are defined during this phase.

2. **Formulation**: During this phase, the acceptance criteria are converted into executable specifications using a structured language like Gherkin. These specifications are written in a way that describes the expected behaviour of the application in various scenarios.

3. **Automation**: In the final phase, the executable specifications are automated using a BDD framework like Cucumber. The automated tests are run to validate that the application behaves as expected. Although BDD can be applied at different levels of the testing pyramid, we will focus on End-to-End (E2E) testing in this project. E2E tests are used to test the entire application from the user's perspective. They simulate real user interactions with the application and validate that the application behaves as expected.

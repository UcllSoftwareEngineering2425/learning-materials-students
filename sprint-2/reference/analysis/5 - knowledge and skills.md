## Skills

* Analyse a new piece of functionality:
  * Divide the functionality in stories in a story map
  * Bridge the boundary between the requirements and the technical team by working out the story map in user stories
  * Present well-structured stories written from the viewpoint of personas and including mockups
  * Make stories verifiable by including testable acceptance criteria for happy and unhappy cases
  * Group stories in epics so they can be added to the product backlog
  * Model the structure of the software solution by drawing data models, a domain model and sequence diagrams

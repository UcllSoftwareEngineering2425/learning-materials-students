# Modelling

It can be useful to accompany your user stories with models.

Models explain the structure of the application from different viewpoints. Each viewpoint highlights and visualises another element of the application.

The following models are of particular importance:

* The [conceptual and logical data models](https://www.couchbase.com/blog/conceptual-physical-logical-data-models/#:~:text=A%20conceptual%20data%20model%20is,to%20create%20a%20real%20database.)
  * These are covered in-depth in the course "Database Foundations"
* The [domain model](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/agile-project-management/domain-modeling-what-you-need-to-know-before-coding)
* The [sequence diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-sequence-diagram)

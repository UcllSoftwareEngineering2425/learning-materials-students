# Requirements Gathering

Simply said, requirements gathering is the process of understanding what you are trying to build and why you are building it.

'Requirements' are descriptions of the capabilities that a specific product or service should provide.

There are two kinds of requirements:

* Functional requirements (about the behaviour of software)
    * Business requirements
    * User requirements
* Non-functional requirements (about building a good product)
    * Performance
    * Security
    * Maintainability
    * Scalability
    * …

Business requirements are high-level functional requirements of the application that specify what the application needs to be able to do for the business. Some examples:

* Monthly reports on the sales
* Admins can be added
* Users can be managed
* Automatic emails need to be sent
* …

User requirements are similar to business requirements, but from the perspective of the user. What does the user require or need to be able to perform? Examples of user requirements:

* User should be able to pay
* User should be able to calculate cost
* User should be able to search
* …

You can find more on translating business to user requirements in [the note about user stories](./3%20-%20writing%20user%20stories.md).

Non-functional requirements are specific criteria that need to be met that aren’t related to the behaviour of the desired application. Some examples:

* Usability
* Security
* Performance
* Scalability
* Maintainability
* …

The complexity of requirements gathering is often in the process. How can you reliably find out what the software should do when talking to stakeholders? You can read more about that complexity in the following links:

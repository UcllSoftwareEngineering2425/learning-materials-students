# Software Development LifeCycle

The Software Development LifeCycle is the 'entire process that teams use to design, build and maintain high-quality software'.

While, depending on the source you consult, the process described might be a little different from time to time, the general idea remains the same.

The process of building software can be summarized as consisting of a number of phases, each with their own purpose:

* [Text overview of the SDLC](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/sdlc)

The phases of the lifecycle can fit in different Agile methodologies:

* When developing in a 'Waterfall' model, every phase of the SDLC is often passed through once
* When developing in a more iterative way, the phases of the SDLC are more fluid and are often repeated for every new chunk of functionality

The concepts and tools used will also differ depending on what methodology is followed. For example, the result of the Analysis phase when working Waterfall might be a huge document full with diagrams and specifications detailing every small detail. While the result of the the Analysis phase when working Agile might be an updated set of stories for the next sprint. The next piece of software will be analysed when the team is ready to do some more analysis. An in-between version is also possible: even though work is done in sprints, a high-level overview of all stories is created before the first sprint. Refinement is then done on a per-sprint basis.

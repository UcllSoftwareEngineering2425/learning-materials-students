# Analysis

## Base Application

For the provided codebase, deliver the following deliverables:

* A story map with outcomes, personas, epics and user stories
* A small description of every defined persona
* Written out user stories with mockups and acceptance criteria (for happy and unhappy cases), from the viewpoint of your personas
* Sequence diagrams for three stories
* Data models and a domain model (these models cover the whole application, so they include all entities/classes from all stories)

## Extension

Extend your deliverables with an analysis for **one** extension from the list below.

* Enable lecturers to create an assignment for a schedule. Students enrolled for the schedule can submit (a submission is text-based) and receive a grade.
* Create a discussion forum where students and lecturers can discuss various topics.
* Lecturers can create quizzes with grades. A quiz consists of various questions belong to different types (open question, multiple choice, ...). Students can take the quiz.
* Lecturers can assign rooms to schedules. Rooms belong to buildings. An overview of occupancy of buildings is provided.
* Schedules can be organized in courses. Instead of enrolling for a schedule, a student enrolls for a course (which automatically enrolls them for all schedules). A course consists of schedules and teaching documents (text-based). Students enrolled in a course can see all teaching materials.

Extending your deliverables encompassess the following things:

* Update your story-map
* Update your persona's if necessary
* Write user stories covering the extension 
* Update your data models and domain model so the extension is also included
* (You do not need to create additional sequence diagrams)
